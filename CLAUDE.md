## Vibe Coding: Effective AI Collaboration

### Philosophy

**"AI is a Pair Programming Partner, Not Just a Tool"**

Collaboration with Claude is not mere code generation—it's a process of sharing thought processes and solving problems together.

### 1. Context Provision Principles

**Provide Sufficient Background:**
```markdown
# BAD: No context
"Create a login feature"

# GOOD: Rich context
"Our project uses Next.js 14 + Supabase.
Auth-related code is in /app/auth folder.
Following existing patterns, add OAuth login.
Reference: src/app/auth/login/page.tsx"
```

**Context Checklist:**
- [ ] Specify project tech stack
- [ ] Provide relevant file paths
- [ ] Mention existing patterns/conventions
- [ ] Describe expected output format
- [ ] State constraints and considerations

### 2. Iterative Refinement Cycle

```
VIBE CODING CYCLE

1. SPECIFY    → Describe desired functionality specifically
2. GENERATE   → Claude generates initial code
3. REVIEW     → Review generated code yourself
4. REFINE     → Provide feedback for modifications
5. VERIFY     → Run tests and verify edge cases

Repeat 2-5 as needed
```

### 3. Effective Prompt Patterns

**Pattern 1: Role Assignment**
```
"You are a senior React developer with 10 years experience.
Review this component and suggest improvements."
```

**Pattern 2: Step-by-Step Requests**
```
"Proceed in this order:
1. Analyze current code problems
2. Present 3 improvement options
3. Refactor using the most suitable option
4. Explain the changes"
```

**Pattern 3: Constraint Specification**
```
"Implement with these constraints:
- Maintain existing API contract
- No new dependencies
- Test coverage >= 80%"
```

**Pattern 4: Example-Based Requests**
```
"Create OrderService.ts following the same pattern as
UserService.ts. Especially follow the error handling approach."
```

### 4. Boundaries

**DO NOT delegate to Claude:**
- Security credential generation/management
- Direct production DB manipulation
- Code deployment without verification
- Sensitive business logic full delegation

**Human verification REQUIRED:**
- Security-related code (auth, permissions)
- Financial transaction logic
- Personal data processing code
- Irreversible operations
- External API integration code

### 5. Vibe Coding Checklist

```
